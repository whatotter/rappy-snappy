# rappy-snappy
rappy snappy is a wooting keyboard 'feature' that allows the keyboard to automagically release the earliest pressed key when another key is pressed later, and when that other key is pressed, go back to pressing the other key - so there's no overlapping keys being pressed. this *'provides a gaming advantage'*, but it's up to you to find that out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  

**this works for all keyboards**

you can see it working here:

# DISCLAIMER
this technically counts **as a macro**  
it's not my fault if you get banned off of a game, there are no 'anticheat bypasses' for this as this isn't cheating software
